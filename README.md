Features

Sentiment Detection
Detects simple emotional cues in user input and adjusts responses to offer support or encouragement.
> Example:  
> User: "I'm worried about online scams."  
> Bot: "It's completely understandable to feel that way. Scammers can be very convincing. Let me share some tips to help you stay safe."

2. Error Handling and Edge Cases
Handles unrecognized or empty inputs with default, non-crashing responses to ensure a smooth user experience.
> Example: 
> Bot: "I'm not sure I understand. Can you try rephrasing?"

3. Code Optimization
- Uses `Dictionary`, `List`, and arrays for efficient response storage and access.
- Modular methods (`RespondToUser()`, `PlayGreeting()`, etc.) ensure clean, organized, and expandable code.
